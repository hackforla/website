### Overview
We need to create a single variable `github-handle` to hold the github handle for each member of the leadership team. Eventually `github-handle` will replace the `github` and `picture` variables, reducing redundancy in the project file.

### Action Items
- [ ] Open the file `_projects/[PROJECT FILE]` in the IDE
- [ ] Replace:
```
- name: [INSERT MEMBER NAME]
```
with
```
- name: [INSERT MEMBER NAME]
  github-handle:
```
- [ ] Do not use a tab to indent `github-handle`. YAML doesn't allow tabs; it requires spaces.
- [ ] Using docker, confirm that the appearance of the project webpage is unchanged at all screen sizes. The project webpage URL can be found below under Resources.
