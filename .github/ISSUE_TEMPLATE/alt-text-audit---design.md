### Overview
We need to ensure that alt text for images adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). For this issue, we will tackle the images under the  [NAME OF PAGE] page.

#### Details
Developers identified that some alt texts in the [NAME OF PAGE] page should be reviewed because they are either inaccurate or too long. Ideally, alt text should be descriptive but short and succinct. According to the WCAG page, an accompanying alt text should be short. Additionally, the Functional Accessibility Evaluator (FAE) recommends for alt text to be no more than 100 characters.

### Action Items 
- [ ] Make a copy of the tab Template [Page Name]- [Status] 
- [ ] With the copied tab replace [Page Name] with the page you are reviewing and [Status] with "Audit in Progress". Don't forget to remove brackets "[ ]"
- [ ] Add a link of the page your working on to the Resources/Instructions section of this issue at the bottom where it says "Google sheet Tab for your page".
- [ ] For each item in the list, identify if the alt text needs to be changed or not using the recourses below and fill out the google sheet.
- [ ] When completed change your google sheet tabs status to Audit Complete
- [ ] Review with Design Lead or another designer/researcher
- [ ] Mark issue as done

Development
- [ ]  Create issues for that particular alt text should be created (preferably labelled good first issue) for new developers to fix
