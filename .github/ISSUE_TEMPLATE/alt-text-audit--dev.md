### Prerequisite
Please make sure you have read our **[Hack for LA Contributing Guide](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md)** before you claim/start working on an issue.

### Overview
As a developer, we need to provide clear and descriptive alt text on the `[INSERT PAGE HERE]` page so that we adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and we can achieve our mission of inclusivity.

### Action Items
- [ ] Change the image alt property value within `[INSERT PATH OF FILE HERE]` (lines `[INSERT LINE NUMBER IN CODE HERE]`):

**From**
```
[INSERT ORIGINAL LINE OF CODE HERE]
```

**To:**
```
[INSERT NEW LINE OF CODE HERE]
```

- [ ] Ensure that the corresponding `[INSERT LINKED PAGE HERE]` stays the same after the change
- [ ] Ensure that the new alt text gets incorporated after the change
