### Overview
As a developer, we need to provide clear and descriptive alt text on the `[INSERT PAGE NAME HERE]` page so that we adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and we can achieve our mission of inclusivity.

### Action Items
- [ ] Change the image alt property value within `[INSERT PATH OF FILE HERE]`:

**From:**
```
[INSERT ORIGINAL LINE OF CODE HERE]
```

**To:**
```
[INSERT NEW LINE OF CODE HERE]
```

- [ ] Ensure that the corresponding `[INSERT PAGE NAME HERE]` stays the same after the change
- [ ] Using developer tools to inspect the image, ensure that the new alt text gets incorporated after the change.
  - **Note:** `alt=""` in code while show up as `alt` when using developer tools to inspect the image's alt text property.
