### Overview
We need to audit the [replace with page name] page to know which text elements are missing text components so that we can fix them in the Figma, and ensure consistency with the Design System and Implementation by the website team. 

### Action Items
- [ ] Go to Sample of Audit Figma page
   - [ ] Copy the Template section
- [ ] Find the page on the left panel of Figma for [replace with page name] page .  If you can't find it, use the link below
- [ ] Find the most recent Figma frame/version of that page (It should have a pink frame around it)
   - [ ] Copy in the template below that frame
      - [ ] copy the page in the pink frame into the template (on your [replace with name of page] page)
- [ ] Follow the instructions in the template
- [ ] Review with Design Lead when finished auditing to agree on next steps
   - possible steps include:
     - [ ] fixing the text elements that need to be connected to the design system
        - [ ] make a new copy of page to the right of the audit and move the pink frame to around the new copy, fix text elements
     - [ ] nothing needs to be done (all the text elements are properly labeled and connected)
- [ ] When Design lead verifies this issue is completed, add a `ready for dev lead` label to it and close with the following comment:
```
This is ready for the dev team to create an issue to audit the live website to determine if the designed page (fimga) matches the live page (website).
```
