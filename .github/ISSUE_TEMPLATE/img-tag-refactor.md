### Overview
We want to change an img HTML tag ending with a slash (<img.../>) to an img tag without an ending slash (<img...>) so that the codebase is consistent with how we use img HTML tags.

### Action Items
- [ ] In your local IDE, navigate to `[INSERT PATH TO FILE HERE]`
- [ ] Remove the ending slash in the img HTML tag by changing
```
[INSERT LINE OF CURRENT CODE HERE]
```
to
```
[INSERT DESIRED LINE OF CODE HERE]
```
- [ ] Using Docker, check the page remains the same in mobile, tablet, and desktop views as on the current website (See 2 in the Resources/Instructions section below)
