 - [ ] Note regarding weekly team meeting requirements: All website team members are required to attend at least 1 team meeting in a week (held on Wednesdays and Sundays). In case, you are unable in any given week, you should reach out to the design lead. Exceptions to this requirement may be provided on a case-by-case basis. Also, please let the design lead know (through a slack message in the hfla-site channel as well as an @ mention in a comment of the issue that you would be working on) if you are planning to take a week off or a longer vacation.
- [ ] Review [Design_Short Term Goals, Plan, and Tasks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FxwgdnWBbbQ8Pi3tspnukZTWwXtqnRXfNkNhVMEloY0/edit)
- [ ] Review the [Start Here](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8561%3A72465) and [Design System](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3) pages in Figma
- [ ] Review the [prioritized Backlog to see what Design Issues](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+design%22#column-7198257) are available (this will not be the complete list, but will give you some talking points for your conversation with your lead).
- [ ] Once you take an issue, you will provide estimates and progress reports. Also, once you finish providing your "Estimate" action item below, please answer the question in the "Time spent so far" action item (also below).
   - [ ] Estimate: Copy the text below and put it in the issue that you picked.
 Check this box when you have completed this task so that we can identify if you understood the instructions and know what to do on all subsequent issues upon assignment.
    ```
   Availability for this week:
   My estimated ETA for completing this issue:
    ```
   - [ ] Time spent so far: Copy the question below into a new comment below and answer it. This is just to get feedback on how long it took you to get to this point on this pre-work. There is no right or wrong answers. There is no judgement. It is ok if you take a long time or if you do it really fast or at any pace.
    ```
    How many hours did it take you to finish the pre-work up to and including adding your initial ETA and availability for your good first issue, including attending your first meetings?
    ```
   - [ ] Progress Reports: Copy the below and put it in the issue once you have been assigned to the issue at least 5 days (we check weekly on Fridays), or sooner if you have something to report.  If you finish this issue before 5 days are reached, Yeah!!, do it on your next issue.  This update should be done every week for every issue.  The checkbox here is meant for us to see if you understood the instructions when you end up doing your first weekly progress update.
    ```
    Provide Update
    1. Progress
    2. Blockers
    3. Availability
    4. ETA
    ```
### Additional notes:
- [ ] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.
- [ ] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.
Progress through issues with increasing complexity in the following order:
  - Good first issue (one per person)
  - Good second issue (one per person)
  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)
  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)
  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)
- [ ] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.

### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?
- First, you should post the question as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points
- Then, add the issue to the "Design Weekly Meeting Agenda" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next design meeting
- You may also add the label "Status: Help Wanted" so other designers can see it and potentially help answer your question
- Lastly, you can post your question in the hfla slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other volunteers can see and respond
