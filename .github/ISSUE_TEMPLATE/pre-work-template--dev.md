That way we can help you resolve any set up issues immediately.
- [ ] Read section 2.1 - 2.4 in [Part 2: How the Website team works with GitHub issues within Contributing.md](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md#part-2-how-the-website-team-works-with-github-issues)

  - [ ] Use the information from part 2 to assign yourself your first issue under the Project Board's Prioritized Backlog column and use [2.7 Working on a Issue within Contributing.md](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md#27-working-on-an-issue) to start working on your issue
- [ ] Once you take a good first issue, you will provide estimates and progress reports. Also, once you finish providing your "Estimate" action item below, please answer the question in the "Time spent so far" action item (also below).
   - [ ] Estimate: Copy the below and put it in the "good first issue" that you picked.
 Check this box when you have completed this task so that we can identify if you understood the instructions and know what to do on all subsequent issues upon assignment.
    ```
   Availability for this week:
   My estimated ETA for completing this issue:
    ```
   - [ ] Time spent so far: Copy the question below into a new comment below and answer it. This is just to get feedback on how long it took you to get to this point on this pre-work. There is no right or wrong answers. There is no judgement. It is ok if you take a long time or if you do it really fast or at any pace.
    ```
    How many hours did it take you to finish the pre-work up to and including adding your initial ETA and availability for your good first issue, including attending your first meetings?
    ```
   - [ ] Progress Reports: Copy the below and put it in the issue once you have been assigned to the issue at least 5 days (we check weekly on Fridays), or sooner if you have something to report.  If you finish this issue before 5 days are reached, Yeah!!, do it on your next issue.  This update should be done every week for every issue.  The checkbox here is meant for us to see if you understood the instructions when you end up doing your first weekly progress update.
    ```
    Provide Update
    1. Progress
    2. Blockers
    3. Availability
    4. ETA
    ```
- [ ] Read sections 3.1.a - 3.1.c in [3.1 How to make a pull request](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/2e3c45fede99e61f479548ccca3f0dda83e351db/CONTRIBUTING.md#31-how-to-make-a-pull-request) to learn more about how to make a pull request (PR) for the issue that you are working on and how to make changes to your PR if changes are requested by the reviewer
- [ ] Additional notes:
   - [ ] Please don't forget to review pull requests whenever you are able to.  The [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests) guide will teach you how to review pull requests.
   - [ ] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.
- [ ] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.
Progress through issues with increasing complexity in the following order:
  - Good first issue
  - Good second issue
  - Small 
  - Medium 
  - Large
    - The reasons for this progression are:
      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.
      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.
      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.
- [ ] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their classes)
- [ ] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.

### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?
- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points
- Then, add the issue to the "Development team meeting discussion items" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting
- You may also add the label "Status: Help Wanted" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question
- Lastly, you can post your question in the hfla slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other volunteers can see and respond
