### Overview

### Special Notes
1. It may take you a few weeks to finish this issue, because part of it is learning how to provide updates on issues that take more than a week to complete.    Please keep this issue open until you have been able to do all the steps.  
2. Usually we don't want to you have more than one issue assigned to you at a time, this issue is the exception, because it is instructions on how to work on other issues.
3. The action items listed below should mostly be worked on in a sequential order. However, you don't have to wait on one if you can proceed with the others, For instance, you don't have to wait for attending a weekly meeting before setting up your dev environment.

- [ ] Additional notes:
   - [ ] Please don't forget to review pull requests whenever you are able to.  The [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests) guide will teach you how to review pull requests.
   - [ ] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.
- [ ] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.
Progress through issues with increasing complexity in the following order:
  - Good first issue (one per person)
  - Good second issue (one per person)
  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)
  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)
  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)
    - The reasons for this progression are:
      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.
      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.
      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.
    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:
      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity
      - Special request by a lead or pm
- [ ] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma
- [ ] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)
- [ ] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.

### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?
- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.
- Then, add the label "Status: Help Wanted" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.
- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.
- Lastly, you can add the issue to the "Development team meeting discussion items" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.
