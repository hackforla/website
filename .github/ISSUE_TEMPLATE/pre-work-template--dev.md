- Then, add the issue to the "Questions / In Review" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting
- You may also add the label "Status: Help Wanted" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question
- Lastly, you can post your question in the hfla slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other volunteers can see and respond
