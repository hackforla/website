### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?
- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points
- Then, add the issue to the "Questions / In Review" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting
- You may also add the label "Status: Help Wanted" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question
- Lastly, you can post your question in the hfla slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other volunteers can see and respond
