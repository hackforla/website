### Prerequisite
We are looking forward to having you on our team. Please make sure to attend the general Hack for LA onboarding to get the process started https://meetup.com/hackforla/events.

### Overview
As a developer on the Website team this issue will be your companion and a place to track your progress with the path we have set out for you.

### Special Notes
1. This issue will stay open for as long as you are on the Website team.  Use it as a place to indicate that you have completed a level as well as get instructions on how to progress. 
2. Usually we don't want you to have more than one issue assigned to you at a time, this issue is the exception, because it is instructions on how to work on other issues.  Do not close this issue until you leave the team (please see to do items associated with leaving professionally).
3. The action items listed below should mostly be worked on in a sequential order. However, you don't have to wait on one if you can proceed with the others. For instance, you don't have to wait for attending a weekly meeting before setting up your dev environment.  
4. During the general Hack for LA onboarding, you will be directed to fill out a form that will add you to the Website team Google Drive and GitHub teams, and then you will add yourself to the roster.  If you have not done that yet, you will not be able to do the action items in section 1.
5. The template that this issue is made from is a work in progress.  We will be updating it, and possibly updating your issue.  It works through section 17.  But after that it's still a work in progress.  If any of the links don't work, please leave a note in the comments on this issue https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/4944, and we will get you an update.

#### 10 - UNDERSTAND HOW TO PROGRESS THROUGH ISSUES IN THE PRIORITIZED BACKLOG AND ON ISSUE MAKING AND TEMPERATURE CHECK
Congrats on making it this far.  Issues get more complicated from here, either they include more changes, or have several files to change or you have to research something that we are unsure how to do, or there is complicated logic that needs writing or rewriting. Each issue size that you take on will guide you to a more complicated level in sequence, and you can see from the labels and overviews what they are about.  

Its important that you try to work on issues that fill in gaps in your knowledge (see the self tests for a reminder about what to look for).  
- [INTAKE  Self Test](#Intake_Skills_List)
- [ONGOING Skills List](#Ongoing_Skills_List)

So keep going, the fun stuff is about to start.

Having said that, we are also going to have you take on some issue making (surprise! There is no issue making fairy, only volunteers like you that created issues for the people that come after them).  Pay attention to how the issues you have already worked on are constructed and how they change as they go up the ladder. That way when we start you on the issue making portion of the team work, you will know what you are shooting for when its your time to make issues.

Also, we want you on the Merge team.  This will ensure you are a competent developer and an awesome collaborative contributor to any team you join in the future.

- [ ] Let us know that you have re-reviewed your issues, have read the above and are continuing on the team
    ```
    ### 10 - UNDERSTAND HOW TO PROGRESS THROUGH ISSUES IN THE PRIORITIZED BACKLOG AND ON ISSUE MAKING update
    >Up to now we have just been getting you ready.  Now the fun starts.  Are you continuing?
    - [ ] I'm so ready, bring it on (continuing)
    - [ ] I am worn out from the setup and the good first issues but still game (continuing)
    - [ ] I won't be continuing, (please let us know why and close this issue)

#### 15 - PULL REQUEST REVIEWS - Medium
Now that you have your medium PR merged, you are eligible to review [medium PRs, Review Required](https://github.com/hackforla/website/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3A%22Complexity%3A+Medium%22+review%3Arequired) from other people who are following in the same journey path as you.

Please review 3 `medium` PRs.  Each PR requires at least two reviews, so by reviewing 3 medium PRs you are repaying the effort that others did for you (provided 2 reviews for your 1 medium issue PR) plus 1 extra review to help us all make up the deficit for people who submit medium PRs and then drop off the team.
- [ ] reviewed 1st `medium` pr
- [ ] reviewed 2nd `medium` pr
- [ ] reviewed 3rd `medium` pr
   - [ ] When you have reviewed a `medium` PR, please paste the following text in a comment below

#### FAQ section

<details><summary>Are there exceptions to which size issues I work on?</summary>

   - Medium (<s>you can work on one medium issue, but only one at a time</s>one per person, with some exceptions, see below) 
   - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)
- The reasons for this progression are:
      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.
      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.
      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.
    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:
      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity
      - Since we have a limited number of these, you must get approval from lead or pm
    - You can work on a second medium issue if it meets the following criteria:
      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity
      - Since we have a limited number of these, you must get approval from lead or pm
</details> 

<details><summary>What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?</summary>

- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.
- Then, add the label `Status: Help Wanted` so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.
- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site Slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.
- Lastly, you can add the issue to the <s>"Development team meeting discussion items"</s> "Questions/In Review" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.
</details> 

<details><summary>If you need to take some time off from the team</summary>

- For this Skills Issue, please do the following:
   - Copy and customize this response, and leave it in a comment on this issue
      ```
      I need to take some time off from the team.  I believe I will be back on [Replace with DATE YOU WILL BE BACK]
       ```
   - Apply the label `away on hold`.
   - Move your Skills Issue to the `Questions / In Review` column.
- In the [roster](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11u71eT-rZTKvVP8Yj_1rKxf2V45GCaFz4AXA7tS_asM/edit?gid=0#gid=0), find the line with your information on it and fill in your info for the following columns:
   - Find Column N / "Hiatus". Put `TRUE` in that column.
   - Find column O / "If on Hiatus, return date (YY-MM-DD)". Fill in your expected return date in YY-MM-DD format. 
- In addition, if you are assigned to an open issue (other than your Skills Issue), do the following for that issue:
   - If you have done some work on the issue, please write thorough documentation in a comment in that issue so that the issue can be handed off to another person, who can pick up working where you left off based on your notes.
   - Apply a `ready for prioritization` label.
   - Move it to the 'New Issue Approval` column.
   - Then, unassign yourself from that issue.
