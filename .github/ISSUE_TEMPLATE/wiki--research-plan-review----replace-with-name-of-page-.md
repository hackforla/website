### Overview
We need to make all the research pages in the wiki uniform so that we can determine what is missing and what next steps are

### Action Items
- [ ] Review [REPLACE WITH NAME OF PAGE] of the wiki to make sure it has the correct format
- [ ] Add any titles that are missing
- [ ] Move content into the correct categories
- [ ] Order the items the same way that they exist in the format template below
- [ ] Take Inventory of Assets
   - [ ] Name of Research
   - [ ] Research Date: 
   - [ ] Current Status
   - [ ] Outstanding task items
   - [ ] Research Plan (including Audience Identification documentation)
   - [ ] Scripts
   - [ ] Interview recordings & Transcripts
   - [ ] Synthesis (Miro or Figjam)
   - [ ] Presentation of Findings	
   - [ ] Action Items Spreadsheet
- [ ] Check to see if there are more assets or assets (in the folder) from related research that are needed on this page, and add them
- [ ] Check all the issues labeled research that do not have an RP label already assigned, to see if they are connected to this issue.  
  - [ ] add RP[replace with number] to this issue and any issues that need it
- [ ] Evaluate all the research assets and summarize the status of the research under  "Current Status"
- [ ] List out next steps under "Outstanding Task Items"
