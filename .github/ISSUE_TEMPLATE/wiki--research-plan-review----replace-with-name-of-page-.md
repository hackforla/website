   - [ ] Name of Research
   - [ ] Research Date:
   - [ ] Current Status
   - [ ] Outstanding task items
   - [ ] Research Plan (including Audience Identification documentation)
   - [ ] Scripts
   - [ ] Interview recordings & Transcripts
   - [ ] Synthesis (Miro or Figjam)
   - [ ] Presentation of Findings
   - [ ] Action Items Spreadsheet
- [ ] Check to see if there are more assets or assets (in the folder) from related research that are needed on this page, and add them
