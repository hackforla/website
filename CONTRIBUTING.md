## **Part 1: Setting up the development environment**
### **1.1 Dev setup (1): Join the repository team**

In the `hfla-site` Slack channel, send an introductory message with your GitHub handle/username asking to be added to the Hack for LA website GitHub repository (this repository).

**NOTE:** Once you have accepted the GitHub invite (comes via email or in your GitHub notifications), **please do the following**:

1. Make your own Hack for LA GitHub organization membership public by following this [guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership#changing-the-visibility-of-your-organization-membership).
2. Set up two-factor authentication on your account by following this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/configuring-two-factor-authentication).

### **1.2 Dev setup (2): Installing Git**

Before cloning your forked repository to your local machine, you must have Git installed. You can find instructions for installing Git for your operating system [**here**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). Please note that if you have a Mac the page offers several options (see other option, if you need to conserve hard drive space) including:

- an ‚Äúeasiest‚Äù option (this version is fine for use at hackforla): This option would take just over 4GB.
- a ‚Äúmore up to date‚Äù option (not required but optional if you want it): This option prompts you to go to install an 8GB package manager called Homebrew.
- Other option: If your computer is low on space, you can use this [tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/homebrew-install-use) to install XCode Command Tools and a lighter version of Homebrew and then install Git using this command: ```$ brew install git```  which in total only uses 300MB.

### **1.3 Dev setup (3): Fork the repository**

You can fork the hackforla/website repository by clicking <a href="https://github.com/hackforla/website/fork"> <button> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17777237/54873012-40fa5b00-4dd6-11e9-98e0-cc436426c720.png" width="8px"> Fork</button></a>
. A fork is a copy of the repository that will be placed on your GitHub account.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click here</strong> to see a visual example of the `fork` button within the website repo</summary>
  <p><strong>First, you find the `fork` button on the top right hand side of the [Hack for LA website repo](https://github.com/hackforla/website)</strong></h4>
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21162229/137044762-c80f18e8-b785-48fb-a286-81c1117c0178.jpg">
  <p><strong>Next, a modal may open and request where you want to fork this website repo. Please click on your avatar or your GitHub username</strong></p>
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21162229/137045294-3d46b28c-edbb-410c-98f1-13940ecc5c5f.jpg">      
</details><br>

**Note:** It should create a URL that looks like the following -> `https://github.com/<your_GitHub_user_name>/website`.

**For example** -> `https://github.com/octocat/website`.

**Be Aware:** What you have created is a forked copy in a remote version on GitHub. It is not yet on your local machine yet.

### **1.4 Dev setup (4): Clone (Create) a copy on your computer**

Before creating a copy to your local machine, you must have Git installed. You can find instructions for installing Git for your operating system [**here**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

The following steps will clone (create) a local copy of the forked repository on your computer.

#### **1.4.a Clone repo (1): Create  `hackforla` folder**

Create a new folder in your computer that will contain `hackforla` projects.

In your command line interface (Terminal, Git Bash, Powershell), move to where you want your new folder to be placed and create a new folder in your computer that will contain `hackforla` projects. After that, navigate into the folder(directory) you just created.

For example:
```bash
mkdir hackforla
cd hackforla
```

and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_GitHub_user_name>/website.git
```

For example if your GitHub username was `octocat`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/octocat/website.git
```

You should now have a new folder in your `hackforla` folder called `website`. Verify this by changing into the new directory:

```bash
cd website
```

#### **1.4.b Clone repo (2): Verify `origin` remote url**

Verify that your local cloned repository is pointing to the correct `origin` URL (that is, the forked repo on your own Github account):
```bash
git remote -v
```
You should see `fetch` and `push` URLs with links to your forked repository under your account (i.e. `https://github.com/<your_GitHub_user_name>/website.git`). You are all set to make working changes to the website on your local machine.

However, we still need a way to keep our local repo up to date with the deployed website. To do so, you must add an upstream remote to incorporate changes made while you are working on your local repo. Run the following to add an upstream remote URL & update your local repo with recent changes to the `hackforla` version:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/hackforla/website.git
git fetch upstream
```

After adding the upstream remote, you should now see it if you again run `git remote -v` :
```bash
origin  https://github.com/<your_GitHub_user_name>/website.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/<your_GitHub_user_name>/website.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/hackforla/website.git (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/hackforla/website.git (push)
```
#### **1.4.c What if you accidentally cloned using the repository URL from the HackForLA Github (instead of the fork on your Github)?**

##### **i. Resolve remote (1): reset `origin` remote url**

Set your forked repo on your Github as an `origin` remote:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<your_GitHub_user_name>/website.git
```

For example if your GitHub username was `octocat`:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/octocat/website.git
```

##### **ii. Resolve remote (2): Add an `upstream` remote**

Add another remote called `upstream` that points to the `hackforla` version of the repository. This will allow you to incorporate changes later:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/hackforla/website.git
```

### **1.5 Dev setup (5): Set up Docker**

Docker is the recommended approach to quickly getting started with local development. Docker helps create a local/offline version of the hackforla.org website on your computer so you can test out your code before submitting a pull request.

The recommended installation method for your operating system can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/). <strong><em>Feel free to reach out in the [Hack for LA Slack channel](https://hackforla.slack.com/archives/C4UM52W93/) if you have trouble installing docker on your system</em></strong>

More on using Docker and the concepts of containerization:

* [Get started with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

#### **1.5.a Docker installation troubleshooting**

If you are on Windows and get 'You are not allowed to use Docker, you must be in the "docker-users" group' as an error message, the following wiki page is a guide for solving the issue:
- [Windows docker-users group error guide](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/Add-local-user-accounts-to-the-docker-users-group-on-Windows-10)

Installing WSL2 on windows

### **1.6 Dev setup (6): Build and serve the website locally**

#### **1.6.a Starting Docker**

**IMPORTANT:** Please make sure the `Docker Desktop` application is **running on your computer** before you run the bash commands below.

- This command starts a jekyll server locally. The server watches for changes to
the source files and rebuilds and refreshes the site automatically in your browser.

Navigate to within the `website` directory that you cloned earlier in your terminal then run the below command

```bash
 docker-compose up
```

Running the above command will result in the following output in your terminal

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click here</strong> to see an example terminal output</summary>

  ```bash

  hfla_site    |   Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
  ```

</details>

When you see the above output, it means the site is now running and now you can browse to http://localhost:4000

#### **1.6.b Stopping Docker**

 - To stop and completely remove the jekyll server (i.e. the running Docker container):

*(do this anytime Docker or jekyll configuration or other repository settings change)*

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To stop the server, but not destroy it (often sufficient for day-to-day work):

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

Bring the same server back up later with:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

<sub>[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)</sub>

### **1.7 Dev setup (7): Install local codebase spell checker**

You must use VS Code as your local text editor to install the VS Code extension for spell checking your codebase, Code Spell Checker.

The recommended installation method is to install Code Spell Checker directly from the VS Code text editor, and those instructions can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/get-started/extensions).
The extension can also be installed via the VS Code Marketplace website [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker). 

For developers who do not use VS Code, use the corresponding npm package, cspell, and those instructions can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cspell).

<strong><em>Feel free to reach out in the [Hack for LA Slack channel](https://hackforla.slack.com/archives/C4UM52W93/) if you have trouble installing the VS Code extension or the cspell npm package on your system.</em></strong>

## **Part 2: How the Website team works with GitHub issues**

### **2.1 Hack for LA Contributor expectations**

In order to work on a `Complexity: Small`/`Complexity: Medium`/`Complexity: Large` label issue within this repo, you need to complete the following:

1. `good first issue`
   * Self-assign an issue with the `good first issue` label.
   * Complete steps in [**2.7 Working on an issue**](#27-working-on-an-issue) to create a solution for the issue
   * Complete steps in [**3.1 How to make a pull request**](#31-how-to-make-a-pull-request) to get your solution reviewed by the `website-merge` team.
   * Once your pull request is merged, you can work on your next issue.
2.  Repeat #1 with a new `good first issue`

Progress through issues with increasing complexity in the following order:
  1. Good first issue (x2)
  2. Small 
  3. Medium 
  4. Large
  5. Extra Large
  
The reasons for this progression are:
  * The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.
  * We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.
  * It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.

All website team members are required to attend at least 1 team meeting in a week (held on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays). In case, you are unable in any given week, you should reach out to the tech leadership team. Exceptions to this requirement may be provided on a case-by-case basis.

All website team members are expected to devote a minimum of 6 hours per week while working on various assignments during their entire tenure at the website team (excluding week offs and vacations).

Also, please let the tech leadership team know (through a Slack message in the hfla-site channel as well as an @ mention in a comment of the issue that you would be working on) if you are planning to take a week off or a longer vacation.

Prior to joining [another project within Hack for LA](https://www.hackforla.org/projects/), developers should gain the following experience:
* Setting up your local environment from a CONTRIBUTING file
* Completing the above series of issues at least up to `Complexity: Large` 
* Resolving Merge Conflicts
* Reviewing other people's Pull Requests
* Create or improve documentation for other developers
* Mentor other developers
* Create new issues

In addition, backend engineers should complete issues that provide experience with the following:
* API requests
* Cron Job Scripting
* CRUD operations

### **2.2 How Hack for LA organizes issues**

We currently have issues with the following **role** labels:

* `role: front end`
* `role: backend/devOps`

And the following **complexity** labels:

* `good first issue` 
* `complexity: Small`
* `complexity: Medium`
* `complexity: Large`

**Note:** The Prioritized Backlog column is filtered so the first (top) issue has the highest priority and should be worked on next. <br />

**Note:** if you would like to learn more about our label system you can read this [wiki on how to read and interpret our repo labels](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-read-and-interpret-labels)

<sub>[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)</sub>
***

### **2.3 Where can I find GitHub issues to work on?**

The best way to view the issues available is our [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/hackforla/projects/86)


For the purpose of finding issues to work on, developers should focus exclusively on the `Prioritized Backlog` column, which contains all the available issues that have been approved and prioritized. 
**Note:** The column is filtered so the first (top) issue has the highest priority and should be worked on next.

#### **2.3.a Available issues for new members**

Use the link [`good first issues`](https://github.com/orgs/hackforla/projects/86/views/2) to display "good first issues" (for both front end and back end roles) in the Prioritized Backlog column.  

**Note:** The column is filtered so the first (top) issue has the highest priority and should be worked on next.

#### **2.3.b Available issues for returning members**

* `Prioritized Backlog` column in the [filtered Project Board - **complexity: Small** label](https://github.com/orgs/hackforla/projects/86/views/3)
* `Prioritized Backlog` column in the [filtered Project Board - **complexity: Medium** label](https://github.com/orgs/hackforla/projects/86/views/4)
* `Prioritized Backlog` column in the [filtered Project Board - **complexity: Large and XLarge** label](https://github.com/orgs/hackforla/projects/86/views/5)

#### **2.3.c Issues for Hacktoberfest contributors**

### **2.4 Claiming an Issue**

Once you find an issue you want to work on, you need to self-assign to claim it and then move the issue from the `Prioritized Backlog` to the `In progress`. Both of these tasks can be accomplished within the issue. Please see the examples below. (Note: Any issue that you are working on besides the pre-work issue should remain in the `In progress` column and stay open. Once a member of the merge team or a tech lead merges your pull request associated with that issue, there is automation through GitHub Actions that will take care of moving the issue to a different column and closing the issue.)

### **2.7 Working on an issue**

- If you are using Visual studios code you can use the Git graphical user interface to stage your changes. For instructions check out the [Git gui wiki](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-Use-Git-GUI-(Graphical-user-Interface)-in-Visual-Studios-Code)

**Note:** Alternatively you can follow the instructions below to stage changes through the terminal. We will be using [Update ‚ÄòGive‚Äô image credit link and information - #2093](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2093) as an example issue we will be following.

Create a new branch for each issue you work on. Doing all your work on topic branches leaves your repository's main branch (named `gh-pages`) unmodified and greatly simplifies keeping your fork in sync with the main project.

#### **2.7.a Working on an issue (1): Verify current branch is `gh-pages`**

The `git branch` command will let you know what branch you are in, and what branch names are already in use.

```bash
git branch
```

You will see a list of all of your branches. There will be a star (`*`) next to the branch that you are currently in. By default you should start on the `gh-pages` branch.

**Note:** When you work on future issues, you must always be in the `gh-pages` branch when creating a new branch.

If you are not currently in the `gh-pages` branch, run the following command to return to it:

```bash
git checkout gh-pages
```

Update your gh-pages branch with upstream changes:

```bash
git pull upstream gh-pages
```


<sub>[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)</sub>

#### **2.7.b Working on an issue (2): Create a new branch where you will work on your issue**

If you have not already done so, run `git checkout gh-pages` to switch the working directory to the `gh-pages` branch and then update `gh-pages` with upstream changes as described above in Section 2.7.a. 

Using the `-b` flag you can also use the `git checkout` command to create a new branch and immediately switch into it.  

For example, if you create a new issue branch for [Update ‚ÄòGive‚Äô image credit link and information - #2093](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2093):

```bash
git checkout -b update-give-link-2093
```

 The text after the `-b`, in the example `update-give-link-2093`, will be the name of your new branch.

 **Note:** Choose a branch name that:
 * relates to the issue (No spaces!)
 * includes the issue number

**Note:** The format should look like the scheme above where the words are a brief description of the issue that will make sense at a glance to someone unfamiliar with the issue.

**Note:** No law of physics will break if you don't adhere to this scheme, but laws of git will break if you add spaces.

We urge developers to be cautious using `git add`. In general it is not advisable to use `git add -all` or `git add .`. Rather, run `git status`, examine the output carefully, and then add only those files specifically related to the current issue. This will ensure that no extraneous files are included in the subsequent commit.  

When you've finished working on your issue, follow the steps below to prepare your changes to push to your repository.

##### **i. What if you cannot see your changes locally within Docker?**

If you do not see the changes you applied when you run `docker-compose up`, **do the following**:

1. Stop running your Docker application (if still running).
2. Delete the `_site` directory in the root folder (`website`)
3. Delete the `.jekyll-metadata` file in the root folder (`website`)
4. Finally, restart docker (run `docker-compose up` in the terminal) and you should see your changes.
<br><br>

- If the above steps did not resolve your issue, run through the first three steps again, but try resetting your browser's cache before restarting docker (you can also try running http://localhost:4000 in another browser).
- If you still do not see your changes after trying these steps, please feel free to reach out to the team in the [#hfla-site](https://hackforla.slack.com/archives/C4UM52W93) Slack channel, or bring up your issue in a dev meeting.

<sub>[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)</sub>

#### **2.7.c Working on an issue(3): Prepare your changes to push to your repository**

Once you are done with the work on your issue you will push it to your repository.  Before you can push your work to your repository, you will stage and commit your changes.  These two commands are similar to the save command that you have used to in other programs.

**Note:** If you are using Visual studios code you can use the Git graphical user interface to stage your changes. For instructions check out the [Git Gui Wiki](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-Use-Git-GUI-(Graphical-user-Interface)-in-Visual-Studios-Code)

##### **i. Prepare repo changes (1): Use the `git add` command to stage your changes.**

This command prepares your changes before you commit them. You can stage files one at a time using the filename.

Run this command if you want to **add changes from a specific file(s) to your commit record**:
```bash
git add ‚Äúfilename.ext‚Äù
```

Run this command if you want to **add all changes to all file(s) to your commit record**:
```bash
git add .
```

##### **ii. Prepare repos changes (2): Use the `git status` command to see what files are staged.**

This command will list the files that have been staged.  These are the files that will be committed (saved) when you run the next command, `git commit`. Please be sure all your staged changes are relevant to the issue you are working on. If you accidentally included unrelated changes, please unstage them before making this commit, and then make a new commit for the unrelated changes. (The commands for unstaging commits are provided in the output of your `git status` command.)

```bash
git status
```
##### **iii. Prepare repos changes (3): Use the `git reset HEAD` command to remove a staged file.**

This command will remove a file that has been staged.  This file will not be committed (saved) when you run the next command, `git commit`. This only works if the wrong files were added, but they were not yet committed. The file will be removed from the staging area, but not actually deleted:

```bash
git reset HEAD ‚Äúfilename.ext‚Äù
```

##### **iv. Prepare repos changes (4): Use the `git commit` command**

This command saves your work, and prepares it to push to your repository.  Use the `-m` flag to quickly add a message to your commit. Your message should be a short description of the issue you are working.  It will be extremely helpful if other people can understand your message, so try to resist the temptation to be overly cryptic.

To commit your changes with a message, run:

```bash
git commit -m ‚Äúinsert message here‚Äù
```

* If you do not see the changes you applied when you run `docker-compose up`, delete `_site` directory and `.jekyll-metadata` file and restart docker. This will force docker to rebuild the whole site.

<sub>[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)</sub>

#### **2.7.d Working on an issue (4): Pulling from upstream before you push**

**IMPORTANT:** Before you push your local commits to your repository, sync your fork to the main Hack For LA website repository. You can sync your fork directly on GitHub by clicking "Sync Fork" at the right of the screen and then clicking "Update Branch":

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click here</strong> to see how to sync the fork on GitHub</summary>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hackforla/website/images/how-to-review-pull-requests/step3-sync-demo.gif">
</details>

Next, bring upstream changes into your topic branch. With your topic branch checked out, run: 

```bash
git pull upstream gh-pages
```


##### **i. If there are no changes in the upstream repository**

If you do not see any output, there have not been any changes in the main Hack for LA website repository since the last time you
checked. So it is safe to push your local commits to your fork.

If you just type `git push` you will be prompted to create a new branch in your GitHub repository. The more complete command below will create a new branch on your copy of the website repository, and then push your local branch there. The name at the end of this command should be the same as the name of the local branch that you created back in step 3, as in the example below:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin update-give-link-2093
```

##### **ii. If there are conflicting changes in the upstream repository**

When you check the upstream repository, you may see output like this:

```bash
Fetching upstream
remote: Enumerating objects: 11, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (11/11), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (7/7), done.
remote: Total 11 (delta 5), reused 7 (delta 4), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (11/11), 8.25 KiB | 402.00 KiB/s, done.
From https://github.com/hackforla/website
+ 770d667...14f9f46 Bonnie     -> hackforla/Bonnie  (forced update)
* [new branch]      bonnie     -> hackforla/bonnie
5773ebe..0c86ecd  gh-pages   -> hackforla/gh-pages
```


**Note:** You can safely ignore changes in other issue branches, such as `bonnie` above. But if you see changes in gh-pages, as in `5773ebe..0c86ecd  gh-pages   -> hackforla/gh-pages`, you should incorporate those changes into your repository before merging or rebasing your issue branch. Use the [instructions below](#27e-working-on-an-issue-5-incorporating-changes-from-upstream) to bring your fork up to date with the main repository.

<sub>[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)</sub>

#### **2.7.e Working on an issue (5): Incorporating changes from upstream**

Your fork of this repository on GitHub, and your local clone of that fork, will get out of sync with this (upstream) repository from time to time. (That's what has happened when you see something like "This branch is 1 commit behind hackforla:gh-pages" on the github website version of your hackforla repository.)

One way to keep your fork up to date with this repository is to follow these instruction: [Syncing your fork to the original repository via the browser](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Syncing-your-fork-to-the-original-repository-via-the-browser)

You can also update your fork via the local clone of your fork, using these instructions. Assuming you have a local clone with remotes `upstream` (this repo) and `origin` (your GitHub fork of this repo):

* First, you will need to create a local branch which tracks upstream/gh-pages.  You will only need to do this once; you do not need to do this every time you want to incorporate upstream changes.

Run the following two commands:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b upstream-gh-pages --track upstream/gh-pages
```

If you have already created the branch upstream-gh-pages, the following commands will incorporate upstream changes:

```bash
git checkout upstream-gh-pages # Move to the branch you want to merge with.
git pull  # This updates your tracking branch to match the gh-pages branch in this repository
git checkout gh-pages  # Move back to your gh-pages branch
git merge upstream-gh-pages  # Merge to bring your gh-pages current.
```
If you do all your work on topic branches (as suggested above) and keep gh-pages free of local modifications, this merge should apply cleanly.

Then push the merge changes to your GitHub fork:

```bash
git push
```

If you go to your online github repository this should remove the message "This branch is x commit behind hackforla:gh-pages".

##### **i. Incorporating changes into your topic branch**

To incorporate these updates from the main GitHub repository into your topic branch, you can 'rebase' your branch onto your updated gh-pages branch. NOTE you should only rebase if you have never pushed your topic branch to GitHub (or shared it with another collaborator).

```bash
git checkout update-give-link-2093
git rebase gh-pages
```

If you receive warnings about conflicts, abort the rebase with `git rebase --abort` and instead merge gh-pages into your branch.

```bash
git checkout update-give-link-2093
git merge gh-pages
```

#### **2.7.f Working on an issue (6): Handling SSH authorization errors**

If you already have an SSH key that connects your computer with your GitHub account, you can skip this section (2.7.f).

**IMPORTANT:** If you are a Windows user then you have to install Git Bash, but if you are a Mac user you only need to use your terminal. Download Git Bash for Windows here:
[Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

##### **i. Setting up SSH Keys for Mac**

1. You have to set up SSH keys in order to contribute to github remotely. First check if you have any keys set up already.

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```
If the folder ~/.ssh does not exist, create it using
```bash
mkdir ~/.ssh
```

2. Then enter the text below into your terminal using your github account email address.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

3. You will be asked to enter a file to save the key, press enter, and then enter a passphrase. Then you will need to ensure that your machine and your repository are connected by running the ssh agent.

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

4. Next you need to add your ssh key to your ssh agent.  In the command below, replace `id_ed25519` with the filename (without file extension) you provided in the previous step.

```bash
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

5. Finally copy the ssh key to add it to your github account by entering the following command. This copies the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file to your clipboard __Don't copy anything else until after you finish the last step, or else you will have to repeat this step.__

```bash
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

6. Go to your github accounts ssh key settings, and click on the button that says _New SSH key_. In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key. Paste the key into the form that pops up. Click Add SSH Key

##### **ii. Setting up SSH Keys for Windows**

1. You have to set up SSH keys in order to contribute to GitHub remotely. First check if you have any keys set up already. Open Git Bash and run:

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

If the folder ~/.ssh does not exist, create it using

```bash
mkdir ~/.ssh
```

2. Then enter the text below into your terminal using your GitHub account email address.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

3. You will be asked to enter a file to save the key, press enter, and then enter a passphrase. Then you will need to ensure that your machine and your repository are connected by running the ssh agent.

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

4. Next you need to add your ssh key to your ssh agent. In the command below, replace `id_ed25519` with the filename (without file extension) you provided in the previous step.

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

5. Finally copy the ssh key to add it to your GitHub account by entering the following command. This copies the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file to your clipboard __Don't copy anything else until after you finish the last step, or else you will have to repeat this step.__

```bash
clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

6. Go to your GitHub account's ssh key settings, and click on the button that says _New SSH key_. In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key. Paste the key into the form that pops up. Click Add SSH Key

**Advice:** Provide a 4-12 word summary of your resolution to the issue you are handling.

##### **ii. Complete pull request (2): Add issue number to the pull request**

We have a GitHub action that automatically closes all issues connected to a pull request. So for our example (PR [Update Care Link in Credits Page - #2131](https://github.com/hackforla/website/pull/2131)) we need to make the following changes:

**From**
```
Fixes #replace_this_text_with_the_issue_number
```
**To**
```
Fixes #2093
```

**Note:** This will now connect the issue and pull request both close when the pull request is successfully merged.

##### **iii. Complete pull request (3): Explain the changes you made, then explain why these changes were needed**

In bullet point form, explain the changes you made in order to complete the action items within your issue and why. [@adrianang](https://github.com/adrianang) provided the following summary in PR [Add Project to Website: Tech Work Experience #4911](https://github.com/hackforla/website/pull/4911):

Once your pull request is merged you can delete your branch with the following command:

```bash
git branch -d update-give-link-2093
```

Now you are all set to work on a new PR. Start over at [**2.3 Where can I find GitHub issues to work on?**](#23-where-can-i-find-github-issues-to-work-on) and repeat completing parts 2 and 3.

#### **3.1.c Editing a submitted pull request**
If you find an error in your code or your reviewer asks you to make a change, please avoid editing your code directly from the pull request. Instead update it in your local branch first and then push it to your origin remote. This will update the original pull request.


For new volunteers, check this [wiki on completing pull request reviews](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-Review-Pull-Requests), [visual demo on pull request reviews](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b6uW_Od8ftACsEr5u-nxe8qNb8UjkISN), and our [wiki on creating issues](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-create-issues) for more ways to contribute to the project.

#### **3.1.d Dealing with merge conflicts**

Merge conflicts occur when two or more branches of code have been modified in conflicting ways, making it difficult for the version control system to automatically merge the changes together. This often happens when two developers modify the same line of code, when one developer deletes a file that another has modified, or when one developer renames a file while another is still working on it.

Resolving merge conflicts typically involves reviewing the changes made in each branch, deciding which changes to keep, and manually editing the code to resolve the conflict.

Please check out this [documentation from VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview#_merge-conflicts) for more information on handling merge conflicts.
