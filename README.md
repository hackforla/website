## Run Locally

We use Docker to keep development some what sane across a multi-platform team.

Start a build server locally, watching changes in the `site` directory:


```bash
$ docker-compose up
# this will take about 10 minutes the 1st time
```

##### if that didn't work make sure you have the following installed:
  *  [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/#server)
  *  [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Now browse to http://localhost:4000
