Hack for LA is a brigade of a Code for America that exists to connect citizens with civic rights and responsibilities. BallotNav helps those who are concerned about using USPS for their mail-in ballots find their local drop-off points and their available days/times. The app's main features include locating the drop-off points closest to the user, and displaying what dates and times they are available; pulling in this information as it becomes available from county election supervisors; and connecting with users' social accounts to encourage dissemination of the tool and information.","projectStatus":"Active","location":"Remote","githubUrl":"https://github.com/hackforla/ballotnav","slackUrl":"https://hackforla.slack.com/?redir=%2Farchives%2FC0191KE1XB7","createdDate":"2020-09-03T06:53:30.695Z","__v":0},"hacknight":"hacknight","eventType":"Team Meeting","date":"2022-11-29T20:07:59.735Z","startTime":"2022-11-30T02:00:00.735Z","endTime":"2022-11-30T03:00:00.735Z","hours":1,"createdDate":"2020-09-03T07:18:57.604Z","updatedDate":"2022-11-29T20:07:59.735Z","__v":0,"videoConferenceLink":"https://us02web.zoom.us/j/82725358494?pwd=MXcrUHFxWThpS0JwQ1ZKOGdBbjYvdz09"},{"location":{"city":"Santa Monica","state":"CA","country":"USA"},"owner":{"ownerId":"123456"},"brigade":"Hack for LA","checkInReady":false,"_id":"5ff3d01210cf72445ce37e23","hacknight":"Online","name":"Expunge Assist","eventType":"Team Meeting","description":"All Hands Meeting, Every 2nd Tuesday","project":{"recruitingCategories":[],"partners":["NDICA"],"managedByUsers":[],"_id":"5edeab95ce228b001778facc","name":"Expunge Assist","description":"Expunge Assist helps people in California with non-violent criminal records accomplish record clearance, expungement or reduction as a result of Prop 47 & Prop 64.
