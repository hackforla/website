  ## The personal information we collect

  ### Visiting [HackforLA.org](https://www.hackforla.org/)

  We may automatically collect and store data about your visit to HackforLA.org:
  - Domain from which you access the Internet;
  - Operating system on your computer and information about the browser you used when visiting the site;
  - Date and time of your visit;
  - Pages you visited;
  - Address of the website that connects you to the Site (such as google.com or bing.com);

  None of the information we collect about you when you visit HackforLA.org is personally identifiable. We use this non-personally identifiable information to understand how the HackforLA.org website is used, to improve the website, and to monitor usage for security purposes.

  We will not collect personal information from you without your knowledge and consent, except in a few limited circumstances as described in this policy.
  ### Email addresses

  Email addresses obtained through the website will not be sold or given to private companies for marketing purposes. The information collected is subject to the access and confidentiality provisions of the Public Records Act, other applicable sections of the California code, as well as federal laws. Individuals can cancel any communications regarding new service updates at any time.

  ### Google Analytics

  We use Google Analytics to understand how visitors use our site and to gather aggregate performance metrics. We've set up Google Analytics so that it doesn’t collect your full IP address. We don't collect any personally identifiable information using Google Analytics, and we do not combine the information collected through Google Analytics with any personally identifiable information.

  Google Analytics places a cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user. This cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Use](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/).

  To provide website visitors the ability to prevent their data from being used by Google Analytics, Google has developed the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. This add-on instructs Google Analytics running on websites to prohibit sending information to Google Analytics. However, the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on does not prevent data from being sent to the Hack for LA server.
