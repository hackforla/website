Hack for LA is a brigade of a Code for America that exists to connect citizens with civic rights and responsibilities. BallotNav helps those who are concerned about using USPS for their mail-in ballots find their local drop-off points and their available days/times. The app's main features include locating the drop-off points closest to the user, and displaying what dates and times they are available; pulling in this information as it becomes available from county election supervisors; and connecting with users' social accounts to encourage dissemination of the tool and information.","projectStatus":"Active","location":"Remote","githubUrl":"https://github.com/hackforla/ballotnav","slackUrl":"https://hackforla.slack.com/?redir=%2Farchives%2FC0191KE1XB7","createdDate":"2020-09-03T06:53:30.695Z","__v":0},"hacknight":"hacknight","eventType":"Team Meeting","date":"2020-09-02T01:30:56.623Z","startTime":"2020-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","endTime":"2020-09-02T01:00:00.000Z","hours":1,"createdDate":"2020-09-03T07:18:57.604Z","updatedDate":"2020-09-03T07:18:57.604Z","__v":0},{"location":{"city":"Los Angeles","state":"CA","country":"USA"},"owner":{"ownerId":"123456"},"brigade":"Hack for LA","checkInReady":false,"_id":"5f5eee386c13e000179d01dc","name":"Happy Hour","description":"Happy Hour","date":"2020-09-08T01:00:47.000Z","startTime":"2020-09-08T01:00:47.000Z","endTime":"2020-09-08T03:00:47.000Z","hours":2,"project":{"recruitingCategories":[],"partners":[],"_id":"5f4b48fb1127403d8c56aa07","name":"Hack4LA","hflaWebsiteUrl":"https://www.hackforla.org/","createdDate":"2021-02-16T10:11:28.088Z"},"createdDate":"2020-09-14T04:14:48.808Z","updatedDate":"2020-09-14T04:14:48.808Z","__v":0},{"location":{"city":"Los Angeles","state":"CA","country":"USA"},"owner":{"ownerId":"123456"},"brigade":"Hack for LA","checkInReady":false,"_id":"5f5eee886c13e000179d01dd","name":"Onboarding","description":"Onboarding","date":"2020-09-08T01:00:47.000Z","startTime":"2020-09-08T01:00:47.000Z","endTime":"2020-09-08T03:00:47.000Z","hours":2,"project":{"recruitingCategories":[],"partners":[],"_id":"5f4b48fb1127403d8c56aa07","name":"Hack4LA","hflaWebsiteUrl":"https://www.hackforla.org/","createdDate":"2021-02-16T10:11:28.088Z"},"createdDate":"2020-09-14T04:16:08.276Z","updatedDate":"2020-09-14T04:16:08.276Z","__v":0},{"location":{"city":"Los Angeles","state":"CA","country":"USA"},"owner":{"ownerId":"123456"},"brigade":"Hack for LA","checkInReady":false,"_id":"5f5eeebf6c13e000179d01de","name":"Onboarding","description":"Onboarding","date":"2020-09-09T01:00:47.000Z","startTime":"2020-09-09T01:00:47.000Z","endTime":"2020-09-09T03:00:47.000Z","hours":2,"project":{"recruitingCategories":[],"partners":[],"_id":"5f4b48fb1127403d8c56aa07","name":"Hack4LA","hflaWebsiteUrl":"https://www.hackforla.org/","createdDate":"2021-02-16T10:11:28.088Z"},"createdDate":"2020-09-14T04:17:03.419Z","updatedDate":"2020-09-14T04:17:03.419Z","__v":0},{"location":{"city":"Santa Monica","state":"CA","country":"USA"},"owner":{"ownerId":"123456"},"brigade":"Hack for LA","checkInReady":false,"_id":"5f8117007553010017f625da","project":{"recruitingCategories":[],"partners":["Code for America & its Brigades"],"_id":"5fa07c4c1f16a2072828abf3","name":"Civic Tech Structure","description":"Each of the 80+ Code for America Brigades is an experiment which generates valuable learnings and new effective processes and practices.
