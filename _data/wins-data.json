      "As an over 50 year old career changer I was amazed at how supportive the community at HackforLA was in my finding meaningful employment in the local tech industry.  Through exposure and application of Agile frameworks and user centered design thinking my time and practice at HfLA was instrumental in building my modern application skills competency and confidence.  A direct result of my time at HfLA is that I was able to ace my 45min White Boarding interview where I had to diagram a workflow from end to end and identify areas that would benefit from automation.
