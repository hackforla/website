            <p class="accordion">What is 2FA? </p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is an extra layer of security used when logging into websites or apps. With 2FA, you have to log in with your username and password, and then provide another form of authentication that only you know or have access to.</p>
                <a href="">Read more information about 2FA at GitHub</a>

            </div>

            <p class="accordion">Why set up 2FA now? </p>
            <div class="panel">
                <ul>
                    <li>We are in the process of establishing best practices on Hack for LA projects and in the HfLA  organization’s GitHub account.</li>
                    <li>There have been recent news items about hackers attempting to hold open source  repositories for ransom. Although these attempts have mostly been unsuccessful, it is still a  good reminder that we should use security best practices.</li>
                </ul>

            </div>
            <p class="accordion">Encountering challenges using Git CLI after setting up 2FA? (Developers) </p>
            <div class="panel">

                <p>You might encounter a challenge using the Git CLI after enabling 2-Factor Authentication if you have not used the ssh link for the repo URL.</p><br>

                <p class="indent">If you clone via the ssh URL for a repo, e.g.</p>
                <p class="indent"><mark class="highlight"><code>git@github.com:hackforla/governance.git</code></mark></p>
                <p class="indent">instead of the <mark class="highlight">https</mark> URL, e.g.</p>
                <p class="indent"><mark class="highlight"><code>https://github.com/hackforla/governance.git</code></mark></p>
                <p class="indent">then you probably won't run into any issues after enabling 2FA, as you already use an SSH key.</p><br>

                <p>Read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh" target="blank">connecting to GitHub with SSH.</a></p>
                <p>Also, these steps might help you get the CLI auth working again:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Try pushing code from the CLI, if you get rejected unexpectedly it’s 2FA (if you enabled it)</p></li>
