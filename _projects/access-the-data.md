title: Access The Data
description: "With government policies increasingly relying on data and data analysis, it becomes imperative to increase citizens'access and understanding of local government data in order to be effective advocates for their communities.
We are currently working on an MVP, which is a website that will serve as a foundation for the continued Access the Data project. The MVP will consist of a website that hosts a catalog of sources of open government data. This project will focus on Los Angeles County as its backdrop to test the hypothesis
that this is a tool the community of community activists and data experts needs and wants."

problem: Policies that impact the public are increasingly advised by surveys and other means of data collection. To ensure that citizens are empowered advocates of their community, we are looking to identify the areas where data literacy education within our communities is needed most.
solution: Hack for LA’s Access the Data team, in partnership with the Los Angeles Department of Neighborhood Empowerment, Neighborhood Councils, and the Los Angeles Mayor’s office, will be developing modules to address those areas.
impact: Citizens will be empowered to advocate for change in their communities by using publicly available data and asking for data to be made available when it is required for advocacy.
