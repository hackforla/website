title: Access The Data
description: "With government policies increasingly relying on data and data analysis, it becomes imperative to increase citizens' 
access and understanding of local government data in order to be effective advocates for their communities.
<br><br>
We are currently working on an MVP, which is a website that will serve as a foundation for the continued Access the Data 
project. The MVP will consist of a website that hosts a catalog of sources of open government data. This project will 
focus on Los Angeles County as its backdrop to test the hypothesis that this is a tool the community of community 
activists and data experts needs and wants."
