title: BallotNav
description: BallotNav will help voters quickly find the location, times of operation, and due date for dropping off mail-in ballots in person. Due to COVID-19 and cuts to the United States Postal Service, some voters may feel insecure not only about going out to the polls, but also about utilizing the mail to cast their vote. While it is possible to drop off your mail-in ballot in person, the rules for doing so are not clearly outlined in one single location. Information is scattered across state and county websites, each of which may individually fail to provide one or more elements of crucial information, such as available ballot drop-off times. The BallotNav project will collect this data through a network of brigade partnerships and update it accordingly leading up to November’s election.<br><br>BallotNav’s overall goal is to provide information that helps voters cast their ballots safely and correctly, and avoid accidental disenfranchisement.
