title: BallotNav
description: BallotNav is a tool that aims to help prevent disenfranchisement by providing reliable and up to date information on ballot drop off locations across the US. While some states have detailed information about ballot drop off locations, others leave it up to the local jurisdiction to publish that information. In some states, Counties, Towns, Parishes, etc, do not have websites, so there is no reliable online source for ballot drop off information. BallotNav was created to provide a reliable online resource about where to drop your ballot, hours, accessibility, etc. We do this by calling each Jurisdictional office provided by the secretary of state and confirming locations details.
