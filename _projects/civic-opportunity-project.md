title: Civic Opportunity Project
description: The mission of the Civic Opportunity project is to develop and curate the journey of all volunteers that we interact with to reach their fullest potential. Relationship bridge-building and workforce readiness development of volunteers is at the core of the Hack for LA brand. We have found that this effort enables and supports the delivery of a consistent pipeline of knowledge worker resources. In turn, our volunteers are more prepared to create products that are impactful in local government and beyond.
