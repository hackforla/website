title: Civic Tech Index
description: Our goal of the project is to create a comprehensive, searchable index of all civic tech open source software projects around the world. We have created the framework. Now our next step is to create a website and other marketing tools that will demonstrate the power of the index and will provide instructions for how to tag and share your github repository in 2 min or less.
