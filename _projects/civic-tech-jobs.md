title: Civic Tech Jobs
description: The CivicTechJobs.org MVP website will be a platform to help prospective volunteers find inter disciplinary projects that will be useful for their career development while contributing to positive civic impact and a CMS for Hack for LA projects to be able to list their open roles.<br><br>The tool will match volunteers by availability, role, and program area. Future iterations of the platform will focus helping volunteers find volunteer opportunities that match paid job postings, so that a volunteer can better prepare themselves for the marketplace.
