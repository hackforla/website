title: Civic Tech Structure
description: "The Civic Tech Structure project seeks to improve existing structures and create new ones that make it easier to share replicable processes and practices so that the civic tech community can iterate on each otherâ€™s work, improving outcomes for the whole ecosystem.
<br><br>
Our Civic Tech Structure project is responsible for publishing all of our guides and other reference materials that we hope will help other people and organizations to stand on the shoulders of those who contributed before them."
