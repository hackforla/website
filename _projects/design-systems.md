title: Design Systems
description: 'The Design System initiative seeks  to empower volunteers with the tools, documentation and templates for creating and maintaining a design system for their HfLA projects.  As Hack for LA continues to scale it has become more essential to create consistent documentation and standards for design deliverables. 
<br /><br />
A Design System is a single source of truth for a website’s designers and developers– a collection of reusable components, styles, and code guided by clear standards and documentation. Design systems are now an industry standard used by the website teams of most major companies.'
