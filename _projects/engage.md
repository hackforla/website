title: Engage
description: 'Engage facilitates and streamlines the preparation of meeting agendas, getting word out to the local residents and compiling feedback from the public.
Engage is a platform to help connect residents (and other stakeholders) to local government. Instead of requiring constituents to be present at meetings, which presents a host of challenges: work schedules, childcare, accessibility, fear that their voice would not be heard, or not understanding the meeting agenda.'
