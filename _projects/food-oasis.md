title: Food Oasis
description: The website is focused on individuals seeking food in Los Angeles who need an up-to-date resource about food pantries and meals. Our mission is to update the existing website, foodoasis.la with a simplified UI and verified data.  Future development goals include creating functionality for referral services that will allow the end user to annotate and update listings through a peer verification system.
