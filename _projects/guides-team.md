description: The Hack for LA Guides Team project is creating guides and templates from the effective practices that HfLA has developed and iterated from our projects. HfLA Guides aim to share replicable processes and practices from Engineering, UI/UX, Product Management, Data Science, Marketing Fundraising, DevOps, Admin, and Professional Development. The project seeks to further grow HfLAâ€™s peer learning and iterative culture, and ultimately improve outcomes for the entire civic tech ecosystem.
