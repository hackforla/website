title: Home Unite Us
description: The Home Unite Us project is developing a workflow management tool for community nonprofits to automate and scale their existing Host Home initiatives, prioritizing streamlining of caseworkers' repetitive workloads, reducing institutional bias, and effectively capturing crucial data. <br /><br />Host Home programs are centered around housing young people, 18 - 25 years old. Their approach focuses on low-cost, community-driven intervention by matching a willing host with a guest or group of guests, providing a stable housing environment for youths who are experiencing homelessness and seeking stable housing.
