# program area card data
problem: Parking citations are distributed unevenly across different socio-economic strata of the city's residents as they use public parking during the course of business or because enough off-street parking is not provided at their residence. The current publicly available Los Angeles parking citation dataset can be used as a basis for discussions about this disparity, but the unwieldy size and inconsistency of this data has been enough of a barrier to make it inaccessible to non-researchers.
solution: Hack for LA’s Lucky Parking project seeks to map the 12.5 million parking citations on a web app that is easy to use yet powerful enough to make meaningful insights about parking citations accessible to the public at large.
impact: Our project seeks to educate and inform city leaders and the community about the effects of Los Angeles’ parking policies, hopefully serving as a tool in discussing more equitable solutions to our transportation problems.
