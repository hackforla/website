title: Public Tree Map
description: Public Tree Map helps connect people to Santa Monica's urban forest. The map includes information about each of the 35,000 trees (and vacant tree sites) in Santa Monica's publicly-owned urban forest (compiled from open datasets, digitized city records, and federal ecosystem services values), as well as tools for users to share favorite trees. To reflect tree plantings and removals, the map updates every day.
