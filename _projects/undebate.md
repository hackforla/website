title: Undebate
description: For down ballot offices like school-board, voters often don’t know the candidates, so they skip it. With declining media attention, candidates for these offices have a hard time being heard by voters. But electing good people is important!<br /><br /> Undebates are automated online video Q&A so candidates can be heard, and voters can quickly decide - for every candidate, for every election, across the US.
