title: Hackforla.org Website
description: The hackforla.org website is our organization's way of communicating with new volunteers, stakeholders, and donors. This project is a good place to start for new volunteers looking to polish their git protocol skills (branches, separation of concerns, etc.). We are currently in a redesign phase, using CI/CD in the run up to demoing the new version at Code for America's Summit 2020 in Washington, D.C.
