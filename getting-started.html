            <ol>
                <li>Send the project lead your gmail email address so you can be added to the Google project drive.</li>
                <li>After you get access to the drive, fill out the team’s roster.</li>
                <li>GitHub setup: If you do not already have a GitHub account, you will need to sign up for a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.github.com/signup'>GitHub account</a>.  If you are not a coder, don’t worry, there is still lots for you to do, and we use GitHub’s workflow tool (the project boards) and their WIKI functions to organize our projects and share work product.</li>
