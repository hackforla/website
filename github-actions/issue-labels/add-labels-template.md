Hi @${issueCreator}.

Please don't forget to add the proper labels to this issue. Currently, the labels for the following are missing:
${labels}

To add a label, take a look at Github's documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels#applying-a-label).

Also, don't forget to remove the "missing labels" afterwards.
To remove a label, the process is similar to adding a label, but you select a currently added label to remove it.

Just a friendly reminder to also move the issue into the "New Issue Approval" column under the Project Board. For more info on that, check Github's documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/tracking-work-with-project-boards/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board).
Thanks!
