Hi @${issueCreator}.

Good job adding the required labels to this issue.

Just a friendly reminder to also move the issue into the "New Issue Approval" column under the Project Board. For more info on that, check Github's documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/tracking-work-with-project-boards/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board).
Thanks!
