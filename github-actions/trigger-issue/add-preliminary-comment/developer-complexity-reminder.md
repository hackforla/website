Hello @${issueAssignee}, we appreciate you taking on issue #${issueNum}, however it looks like you've already worked on enough issues of this complexity. Try checking out some of the issues of the next complexity from the Prioritized Backlog :)

We are going to unassign you from this issue so you can take on another issue.

Hfla appreciates you! :)

P.S. There is one exception to this rule/automation, and that is if you were away for a long time, and need to do the issue ladder again. If that is the case, please post the following note on the issue and on your Skills Issue (Pre-work Checklist). A Merge team member will reassign you to this issue, and will help you get assigned to subsequent issues up to medium size.

I am returning after a significant time away, and need to do the issue ladder again. Please assign me back to this issue.
