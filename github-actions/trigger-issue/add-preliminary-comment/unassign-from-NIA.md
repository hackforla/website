<!-- Template for a notification to the assignee that they will be unassigned because the issue is in the "New Issue Approval" column -->

Hi @${issueAssignee}, HfLA appreciates your interest in this issue, but please note that it is in the `New Issue Approval` column of the Project Board because it has not been finalized, approved or prioritized, and so it is not ready for assignment.  For this reason, you have been unassigned from this issue.  Please remember to assign issues only from the `Prioritized Backlog` column.  The one exception to this rule is if you are writing an issue and the `Draft` label is applied.
