<!-- Template for a notification to the assignee that they will be unassigned because the issue is in the "New Issue Approval" column -->

Hi @${issueAssignee}, HfLA appreciates your interest in this issue, but please note that it is in the  **"New Issue Approval"**  column of the Project Board because it has not been finalized, approved, or prioritized, and so it is not ready for assignment. For this reason, you have been unassigned from this issue. Please remember to assign issues only from the  **"Prioritized Backlog"**  column.  

The only exceptions to this rule are if you are writing an issue and the `Draft` label is applied, or if you are self-assigning to your "Pre-work Checklist" (the issue includes the `Complexity: Prework` label).
