                Enlightened self-interest is a powerful motivator. Our members have access to mentorship, 
                one-on-one help with job searches, and resume coaching. We do project matching to fit skill 
                and subject areas in which they wish to develop new skills, gain confidence in newly learned 
                skills, and transition from beginner to junior, mid-level, or expert - often in areas they 
                wish to add impressive credits to their resume.
