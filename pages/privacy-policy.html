      <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
      <p>
        We use Google Analytics to understand how visitors use our site and to gather aggregate performance metrics. 
        We’ve set up Google Analytics so that it doesn’t collect your full IP address.
        We don’t collect any personally identifiable information using <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">Google Analytics</a>, and we do not combine the information collected through Google Analytics with any personally identifiable information.
      </p>
      <p>Google Analytics places a cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user. This cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>To provide website visitors the ability to prevent their data from being used by Google Analytics, Google has developed the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on for the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, dc.js). This add-on instructs the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) running on websites to prohibit sending information to Google Analytics. However, the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on does not prevent data from being sent to the City’s site.</p>
      <p>Visit https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ for more info on how to opt out.</p>
