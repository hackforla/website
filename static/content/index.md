    these events, we organize groups of volunteers to build technology
    addressing the LA region’s biggest civic issues. Each night offers an

      There are thousands of works of public art scattered around the city.
      There should be one place to see where they are and how they’re doing.
      We’re building it.

      We are building a platform to engage the community to map and update the
      city's parking restrictions. Simultaneously we want to create an app that
      is easy for all people (community members, visitors, etc.) to use to see
      the landscape of parking around themselves. We want to help you avoid
      endlessly searching for parking in all the wrong places and reduce your
      risk of getting tickets.
